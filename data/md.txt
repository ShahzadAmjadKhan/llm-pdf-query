**Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**Description of Business**
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber operates a technology platform that connects consumers (Riders) with independent ride service providers (Mobility Drivers) for ridesharing, and connects Riders and other consumers (Eaters) with restaurants and stores (Merchants) through delivery service providers (Couriers). Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks and facilitates connections in the freight industry. The technology is utilized globally, primarily in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).

**Basis of Presentation**
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC regulations for interim financial reporting.

Management believes the financial statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation.

**Basis of Consolidation**
The financial statements include accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under variable interest and voting models, with all intercompany balances and transactions eliminated.

**Use of Estimates**
Preparing the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts.

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced uncertainties that may affect these estimates in future periods.

**2016 and 2018 Senior Secured Term Loans Refinancing:**
On February 25, 2021, Uber entered into a refinancing transaction borrowing $2.6 billion to repay all outstanding loans under the 2016 and 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan agreements. This included a $1.1 billion tranche maturing on February 25, 2027, and a $1.5 billion tranche maturing on April 4, 2025. The refinancing qualified as a debt modification.

The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loans are guaranteed by certain material domestic restricted subsidiaries and contain covenants restricting debt incurrence and fundamental changes. As of March 31, 2022, Uber was in compliance with all covenants. The loans are secured by certain intellectual property and equity of material foreign subsidiaries.

**Fair Values (as of March 31, 2022):**
- 2025 Refinanced Term Loan: $1.4 billion
- 2027 Refinanced Term Loan: $1.1 billion

**2025 Convertible Notes:**
In December 2020, Uber issued $1.15 billion of 0% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2025. Holders may convert their notes under specific conditions prior to maturity.
---
As of March 31, 2022, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term since none of the conditions for early conversion had been met. The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares per $1,000 principal amount, equating to a conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share. Upon conversion, Uber may pay in cash, shares, or a combination of both. The notes cannot be redeemed before December 20, 2023, and can be redeemed for cash if certain stock price conditions are met.

The indenture for the 2025 Convertible Notes does not impose financial or operational restrictions. Prior to adopting ASU 2020-06, proceeds from the notes were split between equity and liability components, with a $243 million debt discount amortized over the term. After adopting ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, the accounting treatment changed, resulting in a decrease in additional paid-in capital and an increase in the notes by the same amount.

The fair value of the 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022, based on Level 2 valuation inputs.

Regarding the Senior Notes (2025-2029), they are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and have customary covenants. As of March 31, 2022, the fair values of the Senior Notes were as follows (in millions):

- 2025 Senior Note: $1,044
